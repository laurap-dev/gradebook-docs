### Alternate view requested by users

-Currently, the send reports interface shows a list of all students and emails are displayed on hover.  We will keep this view.
-Users would like an alternate view where it just lists all the emails that will be sent. So a toggle switch that allows users to switch between the current detailed view and the simplified email-only view.
