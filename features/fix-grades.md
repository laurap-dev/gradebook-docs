- **Must be GradeBook**: ✅ Required

1. Open your GradeBook spreadsheet
2. Click **Extensions → GradeBook → Utilities → Fix Grades**
3. The Fix Grades sidebar will open

## The Fix Grades Menu

### Repair Options

Choose how comprehensive you want the repair to be:

| Option | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **⚡ Quick Fix: Just the overall grade calculations** | Fast repair that fixes the main grade formulas. Choose this when only the overall percentage or letter grade columns aren't calculating correctly. |
| **🔧 Complete Fix: All grades and percentage calculations** | Comprehensive repair including assignment percentages and weights. Choose this when multiple grade columns have issues. This takes longer to complete. |

{: .note }
> The Complete Fix will take a while to run, especially in larger GradeBooks with many students and assignments.

### Actions

## Tips

- **Try Quick Fix first** - It's faster and often solves the problem
- **Use Complete Fix** if Quick Fix doesn't work, or if you notice issues across multiple columns
- Your actual grade data (the scores you entered) is not affected—only the calculation formulas are repaired
