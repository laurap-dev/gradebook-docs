- **Using colors from this GradeBook** - Colors are saved to this specific GradeBook only
- **Using colors from your global settings** - Colors are saved across all your GradeBooks

### Where to Apply Your Changes

Choose how your color settings should be saved:

| Option | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **This GradeBook Only** | Saves your color choices to this specific GradeBook. Other GradeBooks won't be affected. |
| **All My GradeBooks** | Saves your color choices as your default. New GradeBooks will use these colors automatically. |

### Actions

### How It Works

After you save, GradeBook applies your chosen colors to:

Colors update automatically when grades change, so you'll always see current performance at a glance.

## Tips

- **Quick visual scanning**: Use distinct colors (like green for high grades and red for low grades) to spot students who may need extra help
- **Keep it simple**: The default five ranges work well for most grading scales
- **Consistency across classes**: Use "All My GradeBooks" if you want the same colors in every course
