## Troubleshooting Obfuscation

### Issue: Obfuscation fails

- Use alternative communication method
- Don't send until fully anonymized

### Issue: Problem not visible in copy

**Causes:**
- Problem is data-dependent
- Issue with specific student data
- Environmental or timing issue

**Solutions:**
- Describe problem in detail instead

## Best Practices

### Before Obfuscating

1. Try basic troubleshooting first
2. Check documentation and FAQs
3. Clear description of problem ready
4. Note exact error messages
5. Save current state

### During Obfuscation

2. Wait for completion confirmation
3. Review the obfuscated copy carefully
4. Test that issue is still present
5. Add description of problem

### After Sending

1. Note support ticket number
2. Keep obfuscated copy until resolved
3. Monitor email for support response
4. Be available for follow-up questions
5. Delete copy after issue is resolved

## Alternative Methods

If obfuscation isn't appropriate:

### Screenshots

- Capture error messages
- Show problem visually
- Easier for UI issues
- Less detail for complex problems

### Detailed Description

- Write step-by-step reproduction
- Include all error text
- Describe expected vs actual behavior
- Good for intermittent issues

### Video Recording

- Show problem in action
- Demonstrate steps to reproduce
- Good for complex workflows
- Still obfuscate any visible student info

## After Support Resolves Issue

### Cleanup

1. Delete obfuscated copy
2. Remove any shared links
3. Close support ticket
4. Document solution for future

### Apply Fix

1. Follow support's instructions
2. Test in your actual gradebook
3. Verify problem is resolved
4. Thank support team
