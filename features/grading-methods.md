## GradeBook Types: Choosing the Right One for Your Classroom

When setting up your GradeBook, selecting the appropriate grading method is crucial for accurate and fair assessments. Below is a guide to help you decide which GradeBook type best fits your teaching style and assessment strategy.

## 1\. Total Points System

**Best For:**

* Teachers who prefer a simple, points-based system.
* Every assignment’s impact is determined solely by its point value.
* No need to assign category or assignment weights.

**How It Works:**
* The final grade is calculated by dividing total points earned by total points possible.  
* Larger assignments naturally have more impact on the grade.

**Example:** 
 
A student's final grade is calculated as:
 
- **Homework 1**: 45/50
- **Homework 2**: 80/100
- **Quiz 1**: 18/20
- **Test 1**: 85/100
 
**Final grade calculation:**
 
$$
\frac{(45 + 80 + 18 + 85)}{(50 + 100 + 20 + 100)} \times 100 = 84.4\%\, (\text{Final grade})
$$

## 2\. Standard (Relative) Weighting

**Best For:**

* Teachers who want to weight each assignment individually without using categories.
* A flexible system where assignment weights are relative to each other.
* No requirement for weights to sum to 100%.

**How It Works:**
* Each assignment is assigned a relative weight.  
* The weight determines how much influence the assignment has compared to others.  
* The final grade is calculated based on the proportion of each assignment’s weight to the total weight of all assignments.

**Example:**
 
A teacher assigns the following weights:
 
- **Homework 1**: Weight 10, Score 90
- **Quiz 1**: Weight 20, Score 85
- **Test 1**: Weight 40, Score 88
 
**Final grade calculation:**
 
$$
\frac{(90 \times 10) + (85 \times 20) + (88 \times 40)}{(10 + 20 + 40)} = 87.4\%\, (\text{Final grade})
$$

A higher weight means the assignment has a greater impact on the final grade.

## 3\. Category Weighting (Fixed Category Weights, Relative Assignment Weights) 

**Best For:**

* Teachers who want to **weight both categories and individual assignments** within them.
* A structured grading system where category weights must add up to 100%.
* Ensuring that some categories contribute more to the final grade than others while still allowing assignment-level flexibility.

**How It Works:**

* Categories (e.g., Homework, Quizzes, Tests) are assigned fixed percentage weights that **must** total 100%.  
* Individual assignments within a category have **relative weights**, meaning assignments can vary in importance within the category.  
* The final grade is based on weighted category averages.

**Example:**
 
A teacher assigns **category weights** that must total **100%**:
 
- **Homework:** 30% of the final grade
- **Quizzes:** 20% of the final grade
- **Tests:** 50% of the final grade
 
Within each category, assignments have **relative weights**.
 
**Student's scores and weights**
 
Homework (30% of final grade)
 
| Assignment | Weight | Score |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| HW1       | 10     | 90    |
| HW2       | 20     | 80    |
 
Quizzes (20% of final grade)
 
| Assignment | Weight | Score |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Quiz 1    | 100    | 85    |
 
Tests (50% of final grade)
 
| Assignment | Weight | Score |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Test 1    | 100    | 88    |
 
**Step 1: Calculate weighted average for each category**
 
Homework category average:
 
$$
\left(\frac{(90 \times 10) + (80 \times 20)}{10 + 20}\right) = \frac{900 + 1600}{30} = 83.3\%
$$
 
Quiz category average:
 
$$
\left(\frac{85 \times 100}{100}\right) = 85.0\%
$$
 
Test category average:
 
$$
\left(\frac{88 \times 100}{100}\right) = 88.0\%
$$
 
**Step 2: Multiply each category's average by its category weight**
 
Homework contribution:
 
$$
83.3\% \times 30\% = 25.0\%
$$
 
Quiz contribution:
 
$$
85.0\% \times 20\% = 17.0\%
$$
 
Test contribution:
 
$$
88.0\% \times 50\% = 44.0\%
$$
 
**Step 3: Final grade calculation**
 
$$
25.0\% + 17.0\% + 44.0\% = 86.0\%\, (\text{Final grade})
$$

## Final Tip:

✅ If you want a simple system where all assignments contribute based on their point values, use **Total Points System**.

✅ If you want assignments to have relative weights without categories, use **Standard Weighting**.

✅ If you want to structure grades into categories that sum to 100%, while still having relative weights within categories, use **Category Weighting**.

By selecting the right grading method, you ensure fairness and transparency in assessing student performance.
