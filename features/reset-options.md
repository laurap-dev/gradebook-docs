## The Reset Options Menu

### Reset Settings to Default

Restore GradeBook settings to their default values. This does NOT delete or change your student data—only your configuration preferences are reset.

| Button | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Reset Settings to Default** | Clears all custom settings and restores defaults. Your students, assignments, and grades remain untouched. |

Use this when:
- GradeBook is behaving unexpectedly
- You want to start fresh with default settings
- Something in your configuration seems broken

### Turn Off Auto Features

Disable automation for imports and reports across all your GradeBooks.

| Button | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Turn Off Auto Features** | Stops automatic imports (from Google Classroom) and automatic report generation. You can still run these features manually. |

Use this when:
- You want to pause all automated processes
- Automatic imports or reports are running when you don't want them to
- You're troubleshooting issues with automation

## Tips

- **Your data is safe**: Resetting settings only affects your preferences—students, assignments, and grades are not changed
- **Automation can be re-enabled**: After turning off auto features, you can set them up again through Import or Reports (however you will need to do this manually for each GradeBook)
